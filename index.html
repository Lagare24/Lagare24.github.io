                    <div class="description-p">
                        <p class="p1-box1">Bantayan Island is a small island off the coast of northern Cebu. Don`t be fooled by this sleepy fishing village, the beaches of this humble island exude the same charm and beauty as the famous Boracay Island. The best part is, Bantayan Island is not as commercialized and crowded as Boracay. If you want a relaxing vacation by the beach and witness one of the most beautiful sunsets, Bantayan Island won`t disappoint you. Bantayan Island is blessed with several sprawling white sand beaches and calm azure waters.</p>
                        <p class="p2-box1" id="p2-box1"> Most beaches on Bantayan Island are privately owned or privately owned by the resort, but are open to the public for a small fee. You do not need to check in at any resort to enjoy the beach. It is one of the best tourist attractions on Bantayan Island. Kota Beach on Bantayan Island is one of the best beaches in the Philippines. There are sandbars and lagoons that are perfect for playing in the water or sunbathing. Paradise Beach, on the other hand, is a serene stretch of white sand beach that features beautiful rock formations. Bantayan Island also boasts two natural cave pools, the Ogtong Cave and the Sto. Niño Cave. A natural cold spring feeds both caves, so you can expect chilly water that's great for cooling off after a morning of beachhopping.</p>

                    <h1>Kawasan Falls</h1>
                    <p class="p1-box2">The most famous attraction in Badian is Kawasan Falls, a three-story waterfall with apparently turquoise water. There are two ways to explore the waterfall. One is to choose from a variety of canyoning escapes and it will take 3-6 hours by car from Alegria to Badian.</p>
                    <p class="p2-box2">The other is a short hike to the waterfall. The final stage is the third and highest stage of Kawasan Falls or Kabukalan Spring, from which water flows. If you're not interested in canyoning, you can instead take part in a river mountain-only waterfall adventure. </p>
